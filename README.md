# C-Learning-Journey

## Overview
Welcome to my repository documenting my journey of learning the C programming language! This repository serves as a portfolio of projects, exercises, and notes that I’ve created and compiled while developing my skills in C.

## Purpose
The goals of this repository are:
- To track my progress and understanding of C programming concepts.
- To showcase completed exercises, mini-projects, and assignments.
- To provide a resource for others learning C by sharing examples and notes.

## Contents
Here's what you'll find in this repository:

1. **Projects**:  
   Small programs or mini-projects that implement specific C concepts.

2. **Exercises**:  
   Practice problems and challenges with solutions.

3. **Notes**:  
   Personal notes and summaries of key concepts like pointers, memory management, and data structures.

4. **Resources**:  
   Links and references to books, tutorials, and other materials I’ve found helpful.

## Learning Objectives
Some key concepts I aim to master:
- Syntax and structure of C programs.
- Variables, data types, and operators.
- Control flow: loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Memory management: pointers, malloc, and free.
- File I/O operations.
- Data structures and algorithms in C.
